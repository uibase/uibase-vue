# UIBase

## Concept

* provides own theme UI with less configure.
* to make very simple UI properties.

## why we need this?

* other ui framework is very useful. but its has many properties on provided components.

## I'd like to make like this.

* user create own `theme.config.js` on there project directory.
* type `uibase generate` to generate component files from `theme.config.js`.
* if using webpack, add uibase generate plugin for watch `theme.config.js` and generate components.
* provide typical admin ui for create own theme.
* generate style guide for own themes by vue-styleguidist
